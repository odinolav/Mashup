# Gas vs. Electric Car Comparison

### Summary: The user selects two cars--one that runs off gas and one that is electric or a hybrid--and api data is used to judge which is more efficient / economical given the user's inputted energy provider.

## Website Overview:
  
  - Select zip code, then power supplier (i.e. St. Croix Electric)
    - Display background. Graphical power plants from user-inputted power supplier to show how a user's energy is produced.
    - Perhaps display the power supplier's logo (first image from google images)
    - Scale power plants to ratio of total energy produced
    - Click on a power plant to see L/kWh or kg/kWh and other basic info
  
  - Input the name of a electric car ---AND--- a gasoline/hybrid car (provides a selectable list if just make is entered)
    - displays picture of both, one on one side bottom one on the other in a game-like GUI.
    
  - Race
    - specify city / highway
    - 'speed-up' animation for the car that lasts longer.
      - simply move winner car forwards
      - maybe also fuel up animation on a certain timed scale
    - See which is more efficient / expensive / clean based on your power provider (if your power provider uses mainly coal, electric cars can be pretty terrible for the environment, for example)
